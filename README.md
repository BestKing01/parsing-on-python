# parsing-on-python
This is the code that parses people from the iitu university: "https://iitu.edu.kz/ru/people /"

As you can see there are 2 files "example.py " and "import.py "

example.py - There was an idea of dynamic parsing, but they made it statistical and added several sites, but the code does not work correctly

import.py - There is a parsing of one site "https://iitu.edu.kz/ru/people /" with further data saving on a json file and logging in to each of the people and copying their data both about themselves and photos

Further updates:
1. Bypassing bot control
2. Parsing multiple sites
3. And the most difficult is dynamic parsing of the site with AI
